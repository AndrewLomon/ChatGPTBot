CHATMODELS = """
At this moment you can chose one of 2 latest available models, GPT_3.5 and GPT_3.5_Turbo.

GPT_3.5 - the model is bigger, answers in a more lively language, 
good as a conversationalist, but as is customary for a good conversationalist often makes up stuff instead of facts.

GPT_3.5_Turbo - the original ChatGPT engine. 
The model is smaller, so it works faster. It is more focused on correct answers and more pedantic.

By default we use <b>GPT_3.5_Turbo</b>
